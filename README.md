The given dataset(physionet_A_N.csv) contained data regarding ECG signals.The data was analysed and the type of feature was arrived at using various characteristics of the dataset.The relations between the features were depicted using the df.corr command,the null and redundant features were removed and then the features were modelled by replacing the target output(Class) with either 0 or 1,0 representing Normal and 1 representing Arrhythmia,a logistic regression model was created to predict if a person is suffering from Arrhythmia,the performance of the model was checked and the accuracy was computed,while the same the dataset was analysed using the K-Nearest Neighbour Classification,the Logistic Regression model proved to be more accurate,therby the best fine plot was plotted between the top 2 features that were most related to the target output.
